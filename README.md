# Bank Failure Prediction
## Overview
Bank failure refers to financial entities which can not fulfill loan obligation result from liquidity problems. Since financial institutions are usually with high levity and close cash flows exchanges, any default of an institution will cause ripple effect to the whole financial system. Therefore,  the issue of bank failure is more severe than corporate bond default, for its high social loss afterwards.

In this work, we aim to build a bank failure prediction system by implementing data mining classifiers, ensembling learning and KNN, and compared with the baseline models, linear regression and logisitc regression. The datasets include two dimension, financial ratios from FDIC and U.S. macroeconomic indicators collected by ourselves from 2000 to 2020. Since it is a time series problem, we split the dataset into training, from 2000 to 2010, and testing data, after 2011.

## Literature Review
### Factors for bank failure prediction
### Resampling
## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing
- Missing Values
We remove data columns where 95% of values are 0; therefore, interbank_assets, derivatives_guarantor_obs, derivatives_beneficiary_obs are removed. Then, we use iterative imputor to fill in NaN values.

- Resampling
Using SmoteTomek and SmoteEnn to help the ratio of possitive and negative data resize to nearly 1.
2. Feature selection
- Filter
- Wrapper
- Wrapper + Filter
- Lasso
3. Scaling and dimension reduction
4. Modeling
5. Optimization
6. K-fold cross validation
